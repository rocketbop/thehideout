The plugin creates a nice three-lined mobile menu button (or custom image if you choose) that users can click to bring a slide out menu (from the left, right, top or bottom - again your choice), which is easily navigated. A lot nicer and neater than the select drop-down menu alternative.
<br /><br />
The plugin is fully responsive if you have the viewport meta tag on your site, using media queries with the widths defined by you. It can be used as a responsive menu, mobile menu, tablet menu or full dedicated menu for your main site.
<br /><br />
It requires no shortcodes (although you can use them) or fancy php code to be inserted by yourself making it very easy to install, with 55 customisable options, you can get it to look exactly as you want it to or leave it with its default values to have it looking amazing in just a matter of seconds.
<br /><br />
You have the choice to include the stylesheets and scripts inline to avoid adding any extra HTTP requests to your site or through external stylesheets created by the plug-in. Either way, the code added is extremely small (only a little jQuery and CSS) and there is even an option to minify the output if you wish saving a further 50% on file space.
<br /><br />
It also includes the following functionality:
<ul>
<li> - WPML/Polylang Support</li>
<li> - Croatian translation - Massive thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Neverone-design/490262371018076">Neverone Design</a> for this!</li>
<li> - Spanish Translation - Massive thanks to Andrew @ <a href="http://www.webhostinghub.com">WebHostingHub</a> for this!</li>
</ul>
On the current development list for the next update are the following:
<ul>
<li> - German language translation</li>
<li> - Improvement of "X" animation</li>
<li> - Option to change expand menu symbol</li>
<li> - Advanced shortcode support</li>
</ul>
